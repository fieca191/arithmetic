# arithmetic
This is the program from one of my university etudes called "arithmetic".
The assignment was to write a program that would take in a selection of numbers and the user would select the order of operations,
so either left to right, or 'normal' i.e. BDEMAS.
The assignment only called for the use of addition and multiplication.
